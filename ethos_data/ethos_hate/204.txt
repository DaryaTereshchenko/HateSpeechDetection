Oh Christ, no more autism please, hearing about it as nauseam is starting to make me sick. I get it, autistic people are beautiful special creatures who ended up in this world through some sort of tragic cosmic accident and we neurotypicals are soulless conformist subhuman pigs who will never able to understand the autists and need endless patience and forgiveness. Can we now get on with our lives please?
