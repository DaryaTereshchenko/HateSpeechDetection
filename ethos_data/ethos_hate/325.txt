I visited Melbourne from Los Angeles the first time in 2012.  I told my Aussie friends if they don't put a stop to the immigration, they will multiply like ants.  They laughed at me saying Oz is a big country.  I told them they have to look at it in terms of 50 years from now. Being from LA, I see what the Mexicans have done to to this city. Awful. They multiply like ants and suck up the resources. $$$
