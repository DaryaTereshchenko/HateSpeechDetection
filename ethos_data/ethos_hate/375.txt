The Problem with Islam is that they think they have the right to tell other Human beings what to do or how to be a good Person. What is right and what is wrong. If for example 2 Men love each other, they hurt nobody but you think your God told you to stop them. Who are you to interfere in other ppls Life? Non of your Business! If you think they will Burn for that, then let it be at that. But no, you think you have to stop them bc your God told you. Thats the thing!
