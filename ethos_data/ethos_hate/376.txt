The older Hispanic woman shouldn't have been on this episode. Her view on everything was so shallow and ass-kissy. The story about her brother in law being killed by an illegal alien Im truly sorry for their lost and I hate to sound insensitive but ANYBODY could've killed him. INCLUDING A LEGAL CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES THEYRE ARE TWISTED PEOPLE EVERYWHERE don't pull the illegal alien card on violence bc that's an everyday part of life in the US with or WITHOUT people coming here illegally
