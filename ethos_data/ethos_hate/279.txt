stopping illegal immigration should have been done 30years ago before it turned my beloved los angeles turn into a filthy mexican border town complete with latino gangs millions of undocumented uneducated and povertystricken aliens with absolutely nothing to add to our quality of life but a strong back and a proclivity for having dozens of babies all of which become legal us citizens due to our insane laws and forcing california teachers to have to teach them in their own native language and for no additional increase in their already low wages add to that the free health care and welfare that hundreds of thousands of them are enjoying at american taxpayers expense and you have the blueprint for disaster that is why i left california for good and voted for trump for good every time i see mexican graffiti all over the once pristine neighborhoods of los angeles i want to help build the wall myself but i fear its far too late for that there are now 20 million illegals in america and soon it will become the united states of mexiconow im seeing the exact same thing happen all over western europe from england to france to germany and i will unfortunately live to see the exact same thing happen to them the complete and utter destruction of what were once countries with their own borders their own culture and their own identities all sacrificed on the altar of uncontrolled globalism purposely created turmoil and economic disaster
