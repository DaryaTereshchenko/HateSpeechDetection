People in 2019 keep it that of racism ???... I'm puertorican, my grandma is native, my grandpa black, my mom is "mulata" , my dad is white. I'm white skin green eyes, flat nose, big lips... Haha What raze should I date??... I gonna tell you something- I love all kind of womens all of shapes, but curvy, Latinas, white, black, asian, arabian. I dnt know but every single raze and person have different type of beauty.Â  So lets keep racism down in the floor and rise the love for the humanity. And everybody have the personal choose of dating who's more attractive to them. I choose the mix between white and black. We call mulata...Happy life!!!
