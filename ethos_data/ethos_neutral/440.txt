I really like a lot of what you said here. I feel like i can barely speak up about this side of the topic because people are quick to shut down those who try to be too serious about it. 'Anxiety' and 'depression' and 'mental illness' have almost become buzz words. It seems that a lot of people don't know how difficult it is to really suffer and feel out of control of it all. As you spoke about, there's a fine line these days between awareness and influence. People get ideas in their heads and see the memes and the relateable content and start linking everything to their own lives. Before you know it, you've got perfectly healthy people being tainted by the world and people around them, imposing problems upon themselves and making life more difficult than it needs to be. It desensitises the whole situation and now I have people coming to me with real problems who don't want to speak up because of the upsurge in people talking about it. They feel they wouldn't be taken seriously. And that's horrible. I do understand though that it's an impossible seesaw to balance since so many people are involved and so many minds with a million ideas and actions are impossible to control and have on the same wave length.
