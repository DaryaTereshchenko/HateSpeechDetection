there's nowhere in the world where woman are equal. how about in all the places where they are president or prime minister or queen... how about in America, Australia, Canada, Britain, Scandinavia, France... shall I go on? Like honestly woman u live in an equal world. Stop being so self-obsessed and stop refusing to look at the facts. Women are already equal to men and have been for a long time.
