STOP. DRINKING. COW. MILK. Do people realize that for a cow to produce milk it has to get pregnant? and for people to have such milk the calf cant consume any of it? Do they realize that puss and blood is found in milk and that the milk at the grocery store is only 5 to 10% milk and the rest is just powder and water? Gross.
