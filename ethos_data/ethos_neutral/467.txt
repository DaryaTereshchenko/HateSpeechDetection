I am proud to be white I cant believe that some of these people said that they weren't proud to be white?? I'm proud to be white. I didn't choose my race, so just own it. Be proud to be what your are. You're black? Be proud to be black. Being proud of one's race/culture isn't exclusive to just POC or anyone else. Again, you are what you are so just own it.
