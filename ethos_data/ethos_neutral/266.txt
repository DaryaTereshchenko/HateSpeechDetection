Very sad for those people. i was a young boy in the 90s when Ceausescu fell in Romania and the inflation skyrocketed. But here they are on another level and looks like there is no end soon. How can this happen to one of the richest country in the world? Venezuela has the largest resource of oil in the world. When you look at Qatar, UAE, Saudi Arabia they done miracles. It looks like is not enough to have oil, you have to know what to do with it.
