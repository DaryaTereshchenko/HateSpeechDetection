Germans need to quit blaming themselves for the atrocities committed by the Nazi's. The same thing (shame) is happening here in the U.S. because of the past because of slavery and "stealing" the land from the Indians. People are getting sick of hearing that shit and the left is constantly saying how bad "white" Americans are.
