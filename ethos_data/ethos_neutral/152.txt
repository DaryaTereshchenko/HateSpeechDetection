I'm an Asian immigrant who came to the states when I was 16. Growing up and living in midwest, I did experience lots of racism last 20 yrs. It didnt matter to them how hard I worked to become a doctor, what kind of person I was, how much I contributed to the society... racism that I experienced was purely based on my skin color and accent. And I hate to say it but probably 80-90% of my unpleasant experience was by other minorities such as blacks, Hispanics and even other asians. Yes, some Asians actually treat white customers with more respect than other asian customers
