I don't see why we don't just create a transgender category. Seems the most obvious and fair solution. Great athletes will still compete. And the playing field will be as level as can be.  I mean we create weight categories to maximise the fairness of boxing/mma fights. We recognise that just because two people are both male they compete at different levels.  We can do the same for transgender athletes, surely?
