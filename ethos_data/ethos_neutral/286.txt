this actually makes me so angry. people are just stupidly looking for attention and want to make themselves feel like the most important human on earth. nobody pretends to have cancer or any dangerous physical illness too so why pretending to be dEpReSsEd¬ù and aNxIoUs. nobody should ever feel this way the way it really feels. He has no mental disorder, that's a fact.
