Absolutely excellent as ever, and yes, cycling is fabulous for mental health.. bike when you're happy, bike when you're sad, shout at the rain, scream inwardly at a complex hill climb and get that endorphin rush from being outside.. and smile at your fellow cyclists (and passing chickens, in my experience, a wee bwark at a chook makes many things better)
