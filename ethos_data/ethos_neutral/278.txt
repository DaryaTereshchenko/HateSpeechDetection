This reminds me of me & my husband. I have rheumatoid arthritis & permanent damage in my ankles. I could not walk for 4 days recently AT ALL. My husband is my caregiver when he is home & my RA is so bad I can't walk. I have 2 wheelchairs & my husband often pushes me when we go out when I can't walk. I have canes EVERYWHERE. These 2 are SO CUTE! She is lucky to have him to reassure her. He's lucky to have her to laugh with.
