I'm  heterosexual and African by birth, by breed and by character... and a very traditional man, Xhosa to be precise. But i still believe in human rights... we are all equal, whatever  religion, ethnicity, demography, tribe or language... we are all equal. And one day people will be free enough to love and date whoever they wanna without prejudice and judgment. 2019 Viva human rights viva
