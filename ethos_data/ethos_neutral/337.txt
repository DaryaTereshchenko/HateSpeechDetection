She's a really courageous woman! She is one of the most impressive women I've ever listened to. I appreciateÂ  her film, and I certainly wish her continued success and happiness. She is definitely a cut above both as a filmmaker, and most especially, as a person! She is an incrediblely remarkable woman!
