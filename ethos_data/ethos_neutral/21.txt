There is more history of men hitting women with no provocations. So, that is where the "no hitting women" comes from. Ijs...let's be real. However, I have never hit a man or kicked him in the balls. I'm from the school of "you hit me, imma hit you back"! Man, woman, child you can get it. And trust ima TRY to hit you harder than you hit me bc, you dont want this smoke. However, I do not stand with women hitting men and not EXPECTING retaliation. That's wack. Put your grown panties on and take the consequences. Slaps, punches and especially ball kicking should only be used to get away from an attack, not a reason to prove your point or your emotions.Â  I dont think this is about equality bc men/women can be douches! This is about an equal response to a unprovoked attack against ANY GENDER.
