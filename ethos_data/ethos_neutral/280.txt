this is my theory on the whole thing, was Michael strange yes , but his circumstances growing up he didn't have a childhood and I believe he was trying to be a child for the first time , I remember at the time it was happening just wondering why the parents would let their kids sleep with Michael . it is strange for an adult to be sleeping with the kids I know I sure wouldn't but then again I didn't grow up like Michael Jackson. these two men have had plenty of time to come out about Michael and they choose tell after he dies , their families were set up the whole time they were staying at Michael's house and I don't believe anything happened and if it did it was the parents fault more than anyone's would you let your kids sleep with Michael for any cost? I just have to take Michael's side on this since he ain't here to defend himself
