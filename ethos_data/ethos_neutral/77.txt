All theses people talking about Nigeria, since when have they cared about nigeria? They find it now to care about Nigeria to be relevenat, those who were killed were farmers and Nigeria is living peacefully with it's Muslims. Sure there are terrorist attacks every now and then, but we must remember that those who do kill the innocent are not Muslims.Â  Many terrorists or groups use religion as an excuse. How come Isis are killing their own people? How come Iraqi forces are trying to drive isis Muslims out? Why? Cause they are scum who are not Muslims.
