When are people going to stop asking, Why are they only coming out &amp saying something now? If you have not been sexually,( mentally & emotionally) abused as a child, by an adult You are not going to understand their reasons. If they tell you why, LISTEN!! Stop asking Why now?Â  One reason victims don't come forward when YOU THINK they should, is bc no one will believe them. Not all cases, a lot of use are like that though. All situations are different with different types of people involved, We all have our reasons. If you're not going to listen, stop asking. You're choosing to be ignorant. Being sexually abused & ALL that comes with it, psychological abuse etc. Forever changes you, You're forever damaged & it can never be undone. Instead of looking at victims as a group, look at them & their story as their own. They're not all the same, & we will not all do the same thing after the damage has been done.
