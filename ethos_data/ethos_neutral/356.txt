Okay first of all Drag is not a fetish. It can be but it's not inherently meant to be. It's performance art. Its  a mature form of performance art. Its literally grown ups playing dress up. But yes it's highly sexualised as with anything catered to an adult audience so i think it's downright disgusting to bring your 5 year old child to a drag convention where literally companies  have booths selling sex toys. Its not progressive to let your kids perform seductively infront of an audience, its creepy.
