Trace, I would ask you to rethink the out of Africa myth. Since the out of Africa theory was proposed, there have been many discoveries that prove modern humans existed in other parts of the world much earlier than what was thought when the OOA theory was proposed. For instance, there have been skeletal remains of humans found in Asia that are many thousands of years older than the oldest found on the African Content. It amazes me that there is so much information out there that shows older humans elsewhere on Earth but people still adhere to the falls narrative that modern humans evolved on the African continent
