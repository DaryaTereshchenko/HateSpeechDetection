Lol I'm Korean and most of the Koreans I know do not look anything like that drawing... Many don' have square faces.. You can see the diversity of Korean faces when the answers are revealed at the end. I find this video esp. the initial commentary to be pretty biased as it's ethnically Chinese people telling YouTube how to tell Asians apart. Asians are some of the most racist people to other Asians...
