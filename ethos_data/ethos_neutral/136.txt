Oh, I believe that 13 reasons why romanticises suicide. It's the ultimate expression of the high-drama line you will be sorry when I'm gone, and it's terrible. The suicide scene itself was disturbing, just not in the way it was probably intended to be. Thank you for this. I find that it's more difficult for real cases of mental illness to be taken seriously because of this stupid fad.
